				"Let's dive into the fascinating world of GregTech power, starting with EU (Energy Units)."
				""
				"Now, the EU system operates quite differently from other power systems you might be familiar with. A crucial distinction is the voltage tier system. Be warned: connecting higher voltage tier machines or energy hatches to lower tier infrastructure will result in catastrophic failure ‚Äì think explosions!"
				""
				"Therefore, heed this advice: never connect a Low Voltage (LV) machine to a Medium Voltage (MV) cable. Trust me on this; we want to safeguard our reliable machinery from voltage mishaps."
				""
				"Conversely, never connect an LV cable to an MV generator or machine. Doing so will overload and destroy the cable, leading to a frustrating waste of valuable resources."
				""
				""
				""
				"{@pagebreak}"
				"GregTech wires serve as the conduits for transferring power between your energy generation and your EU-consuming machines. To establish a connection, simply Shift + Right-Click a machine with the wire in hand, or utilize wire cutters. For enhanced efficiency and safety, you can wrap these wires with rubber. This simple step slightly reduces power loss over longer distances and, importantly, prevents accidental electrocution."
				""
				"A word of caution: avoid standing on uncovered wires! The consequences are, well, shocking."
				""
				"For long-distance power transmission without loss or personal risk, consider Superconductors. These advanced wires eliminate energy loss entirely and boast a significantly higher ampacity (current-carrying capacity) compared to their regular counterparts."
				""
				""
				""
				"{@pagebreak}"
				"Speaking of transmission, let's address Cable Loss. This refers to the gradual depletion of EU as power travels along a cable over distance (per wire block). While this might seem insignificant initially, it can become a factor with longer cable runs. Fortunately, as you progress, you'll gain access to more efficient cables and, ultimately, superconductors, mitigating this issue. However, in the early stages, be mindful of power loss and prioritize superconductors whenever feasible. To quickly locate these advanced cables, use the #superconductor filter in EMI."
				""
				""
				"{@pagebreak}"
				"Now, let's delve into the more intricate aspects of Amps and Converters."
				""
				"Amps represent the number of energy packets of a specific voltage tier. While the interplay between voltage and amps can be a bit abstract, remember this analogy: voltage is akin to the size of the energy packets, while amps represent the quantity of those packets. It's crucial to never use cables rated for a lower amperage than the power you intend to transmit. Overloading a cable in this way will cause it to overheat and burn out. Furthermore, exceeding a cable's ampacity can also damage its protective rubber insulation."
				""
				""
				"{@pagebreak}"
				"Converters provide a vital function: enabling the conversion of Forge Energy (FE) into EU, allowing you to integrate your FE-producing machines into the GregTech power system. While they can also convert EU back into FE, this is generally less efficient than utilizing wires, which perform this conversion natively. The current conversion ratio is 1 EU = 4 FE."
				""
				"Finally, we have Transformers. These essential devices allow you to step up the voltage tier of your power. For example, you can use them to transform multiple amps of Low Voltage (LV) power into the higher packet strength of Medium Voltage (MV) power. This is particularly useful for enhancing power efficiency over long distances. However, always remember the fundamental rule: you must still ensure that the amperage and voltage ratings of your cables and wires match the power being transmitted. Failure to do so will, without a doubt, result in a rather explosive situation."
