Within its pages, schematics and plans of incredible machines awaken something within you. A section on \"PhoenixWare?\" reveals only, \"Power beyond reality, created by P‚çëùôπ·í∑„É™‚ïé Ãá/‚çä‚ïé„É™·í∑‚Äîonce one of us, now something more.\" You feel like you should know who this is, but the name escapes you. With a sense of unanswered questions, you exit the temple into the blinding light."
