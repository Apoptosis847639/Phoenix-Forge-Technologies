Resource Generation
Reborn Dimensional Rift Extractor - (Takes raw ores as a catalyst and consumes drilling fluid to use rifts to extract resources
from other theoretical dimensions (needs to be in the minecraft dim where those ores are)
upgrade to the base Dimensional Rift Extractor as it has perfect oc and can take a parallel hatch/laser hatch)
Energy upgrades to the Melliferious matrix means faster bee yeilds
Quantum Ore Nexus, processes ores very efficiently


Progression Multiblocks
NONE OF THESE ARE ACTUALLY NEEDED HERE, NEEDED FOR UEV. MERELY UPGRADES TO SOME IV MULITS IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO THESE NOW
High Pressure Plasma Arc Furnace, made before the rest of the custom zpm multis as it is needed to make stuff for the unstable "circuits"
### **Unstable Large Extruder – “Singularity Compression Chamber”** 
### **Unstable Wiremill – “Quantum Filament Spinner”**  
### **Unstable Material Press – “Dimensional Compression Anvil”**  
All of these names are too focused on singularities/dimensions so will need changed

Side Progression

Tier Materiels(hulls and casings)

Materiel ore proc line/chemicals

Power Generation
Sas's compact draconic fusion mk1
Some kind of PFT Nuclear Fisson
### **Quantum Thermal Reactor (ZPM-Tier)**  
Componet Materiels (motors, etc)
Void-Touched Tungsten – A heavy metal altered by exposure to rift energy.
Quantum-Infused Cobalt – Enhanced cobalt alloy used in high-efficiency circuits.

Circuit Materiels
Phoenix Enriched Naquad, it and its nessecary materiels are made in the HPPAF
Circuits
Unstable Processing Unit, not an actual circuit but it is needed to make the multis for this tier

Alloys
Aetherium Steel – A reinforced alloy infused with low-tier quantum stabilizers.
celestial_aurorium
Color Scheme
Bright orange and black, with some gray as well
Chemicals
Dimensional Flux Resin – A semi-liquid stabilizing agent for quantum energy interactions.
Plasma-Stabilized Mercury
Aetheric Conductive Gel
Void-Reactive Coolant
Quantum binder
