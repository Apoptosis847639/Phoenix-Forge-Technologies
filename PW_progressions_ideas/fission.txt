No, not Smith I meant a fission machine for uhv, my mistake


Ah, my apologies for the misunderstanding! Let's design a fission multiblock specifically for the UHV (Ultimate High Voltage) tier. This reactor should represent the pinnacle of fission technology before potentially transitioning to more exotic power sources.

Cooling: The exotic coolant circulates at extremely high speeds through micro-channels within the fuel matrix lattice, efficiently removing the immense heat generated. The heat is then transferred to a secondary UHV-level heat exchanger for power generation.
Byproducts: Extremely high-level radioactive waste, including a significant proportion of very short-lived and exotic decay products. Requires advanced waste processing and containment.
Power Output: Immense, capable of sustaining multiple UHV-tier industrial operations.

This direct interaction of the moving charged particles with the magnetic field generates electricity directly, bypassing the need for a mechanical turbine. This method can achieve much higher efficiencies and handle the extreme temperatures and flow rates of the exotic coolant. The system would feature advanced superconducting magnets and plasma confinement fields.
This UHV Trans-Dimensional Fission Core represents a significant step beyond conventional fission, pushing the boundaries of nuclear physics and materials science within the GregTech CEu context. Its immense power comes with equally immense risks and resource requirements.
