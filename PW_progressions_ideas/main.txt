the idea for crafting bigger xp chunks in gt only, and the tiabscrafting recipe too, and maybe the phoenixware stuff if you want to

another idea, in tinkers you have to get anough temperature to make some alloys, and coal is fine at the start, then you need lava and then you need blazes
and then we can add even higher temperature tiers
and keep the alloying/smelting of better gt materials behind the gate of you having to get the fuel source first




Fission is everything before UHV

biomancy for uev, de for uix, actually subtractions for UXV, and arivitia for OPV and MAX




My plans for early game for now are, useless materiels used to get trace amounts of ores, 
ie gravel into like vein traces that give a small amount of ore, 
chanced ofc because these will be passive and non chanced is too op, custom steam multis and primitve multis, then tinker's is used to make the first bit of the custom tier alloys before the said tier of machine can actually make an alloy so you need tinker's to get to the next tier
and at ev make the dimensional rift extractor actually 3 different multi modes or actual multis, 
to then use some kind of custom drill "kit" that has a chance of being consumed
one for every dimension
and then the multis ofc go in said dim
Multis getting materiels with catalysts instead of just ore mining is a sick idea

so, i'm nerfing the melferious matrix recipes to only beta upgrades locked to 5 combs per output
not comb blocks, only combs
and nerfing the output chance of said combs
and making the bee breeding/conversion recipes more difficult
and making a whole ah chem line for honey treats


Here's a potential chemical line:

Input Resources:

Honeycombs: Obtained from beekeeping (if your modpack includes it) or perhaps found in the world.
Sugar Canes: A standard agricultural resource.
Milk: Obtained from animals (cows, etc.).
Nuts (e.g., Almonds, Walnuts): Grown or found in the world.
Processing Line:

Honey Extraction (LV/MV):

Machine: Centrifuge or Honey Extractor (LV tier). A more efficient Industrial Centrifuge (MV tier) could process larger quantities faster.
Process: Honeycombs are placed in the Centrifuge/Extractor. The spinning motion separates the Raw Honey from the Wax.
Outputs: Raw Honey, Wax (a useful byproduct for other crafting).
Sugar Processing (LV):

Machine: Macerator (LV tier) followed by a Simple Chemical Reactor (LV tier) or a Sugar Mill (LV tier, if available).
Process: Sugar Canes are macerated into Raw Sugar. The Raw Sugar is then refined in the Chemical Reactor with water (input) to produce Refined Sugar (sucrose solution), which is then evaporated (perhaps in the Chemical Reactor with a heat source) to yield solid Refined Sugar Crystals.
Outputs: Refined Sugar Crystals.
Milk Processing (LV/MV):

Machine: Centrifuge (LV/MV tier).
Process: Milk is centrifuged to separate it into Cream (higher fat content) and Skim Milk (lower fat content). The Cream will be used for a richer treat.
Outputs: Cream.
Nut Processing (LV):

Machine: Macerator (LV tier).
Process: Nuts are macerated into Nut Paste or Ground Nuts.
Outputs: Nut Paste/Ground Nuts.
Creating the Honey Treat Base (MV):

Machine: Mixer (MV tier) or Advanced Chemical Reactor (MV tier).
Process: Raw Honey, Refined Sugar Crystals, and Cream are mixed together in specific ratios. This mixture might undergo a heating process within the Mixer/Reactor to emulsify and partially cook it, creating a viscous Sweet Creamy Mixture.
Inputs: Raw Honey, Refined Sugar Crystals, Cream.
Outputs: Sweet Creamy Mixture.
Flavor Infusion (MV/HV - Optional):

Machine: Fluid Infuser (MV/HV tier) or Advanced Chemical Reactor (MV/HV tier).
Process: The Sweet Creamy Mixture can be infused with other flavors. For example, Vanilla Beans (macerated into Vanilla Extract) could be infused using the Fluid Infuser with the Sweet Creamy Mixture as the base fluid.
Inputs: Sweet Creamy Mixture, Vanilla Extract (or other flavor extracts).
Outputs: Flavored Sweet Creamy Mixture (e.g., Vanilla Honey Cream).
Treat Formation and Coating (HV):

Machine: Assembling Machine (HV tier) or a specialized Confectionery Fabricator (new HV tier machine).
Process: The Sweet Creamy Mixture (or flavored version) is formed into specific shapes (e.g., bars, balls) by the Assembling Machine (potentially using molds as components). Then, the Nut Paste/Ground Nuts are applied as a coating. This might involve the Assembling Machine placing the creamy base onto a bed of nuts or using robotic arms to coat them.
Inputs: Sweet Creamy Mixture (or flavored version), Nut Paste/Ground Nuts.
Outputs: Unfinished Honey Treats.
Finalization and Packaging (HV/EV - Optional):

Machine: Canning Machine (HV tier) or a Packaging Machine (new EV tier machine for more advanced packaging).
Process: The unfinished Honey Treats are placed into containers (e.g., cans, wrappers) for preservation and distribution. This step might involve vacuum sealing or inert gas flushing.
Inputs: Unfinished Honey Treats, Empty Cans/Wrappers.
Outputs: Packaged Honey Treats.
Chemical Substances Involved (Intermediate):

Raw Sugar: Initial product of macerating sugar canes.
Refined Sugar (Sucrose Solution): Sugar dissolved in water.
Refined Sugar Crystals: Solid sucrose.
Cream: High-fat component of milk.
Nut Paste/Ground Nuts: Processed nuts.
Sweet Creamy Mixture: Base for the honey treat.
Vanilla Extract (Example): A flavoring agent.
Flavored Sweet Creamy Mixture: Base with added flavor.
Tier Progression:

Early steps (Honey Extraction, Sugar Processing, Milk Processing, Nut Processing) are achievable at LV.
Creating the Honey Treat Base becomes feasible at MV with the introduction of the Mixer/Advanced Chemical Reactor.
Flavor Infusion can start at MV but might become more efficient or offer more complex options at HV.
The automated formation and coating of the treats likely requires the Assembling Machine at HV.
Advanced packaging would be an optional EV step.
This chemical line provides a multi-stage process with increasing complexity and tier requirements, fitting well within a GregTech-style modpack. You can adjust the specific machines, resources, and intermediate substances to better suit the other elements of your modpack. Enjoy your virtual Honey Treats!
