the idea for crafting bigger xp chunks in gt only, and the tiabscrafting recipe too, and maybe the phoenixware stuff if you want to

another idea, in tinkers you have to get anough temperature to make some alloys, and coal is fine at the start, then you need lava and then you need blazes
and then we can add even higher temperature tiers
and keep the alloying/smelting of better gt materials behind the gate of you having to get the fuel source first
