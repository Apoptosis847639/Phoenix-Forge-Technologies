the idea for crafting bigger xp chunks in gt only, and the tiabscrafting recipe too, and maybe the phoenixware stuff if you want to

another idea, in tinkers you have to get anough temperature to make some alloys, and coal is fine at the start, then you need lava and then you need blazes
and then we can add even higher temperature tiers
and keep the alloying/smelting of better gt materials behind the gate of you having to get the fuel source first




Fission is everything before UHV

biomancy for uev, de for uix, actually subtractions for UXV, and arivitia for OPV and MAX




My plans for early game for now are, useless materiels used to get trace amounts of ores, 
ie gravel into like vein traces that give a small amount of ore, 
chanced ofc because these will be passive and non chanced is too op, custom steam multis and primitve multis, then tinker's is used to make the first bit of the custom tier alloys before the said tier of machine can actually make an alloy so you need tinker's to get to the next tier
and at ev make the dimensional rift extractor actually 3 different multi modes or actual multis, 
to then use some kind of custom drill "kit" that has a chance of being consumed
one for every dimension
and then the multis ofc go in said dim
Multis getting materiels with catalysts instead of just ore mining is a sick idea

so, i'm nerfing the melferious matrix recipes to only beta upgrades locked to 5 combs per output
not comb blocks, only combs
and nerfing the output chance of said combs
and making the bee breeding/conversion recipes more difficult
and making a whole ah chem line for honey treats
