1. Foundational Phase: Initial Power & Thorium Source
Initial Setup: Utilize HV/EV Pressurized Fission Reactors.
Fuel Production: Unenriched "uranium oxide" fuel rods are crafted from abundant Urannite/Pitchblende ore + Oxygen.
Key Output: The low-level radioactive waste from these reactors is centrifuged to consistently yield Thorium Dust, which serves as your renewable primary fertile material input for advanced breeding.

2. Breeding Phase I: Thorium-Uranium-233 Cycle (IV Tier)
Reactor: An IV-tier Advanced Pressurized Fission Reactor.
Goal: Convert Thorium-232 (Th-232) into highly fissile Uranium-233 (U-233).
Fertile (Blanket) Fuel: Thorium Rods, made from your accumulated Thorium Dust.
Driver Fuel: Provides the neutrons for breeding.
Initially: Enriched Uranium (U-235) fuel rods.
Later: The U-233 you breed, once reprocessed, can become the driver, enabling self-sufficiency.
Reprocessing Output (from Irradiated Thorium Rods):
Uranium-233 (U-233): The primary desired fissile product.
Recyclable Depleted Thorium Dust: Unconverted Th-232, fed back into new Thorium rods.
Depleted Uranium (U-238): A crucial byproduct from the spent U-235 driver fuel. This feeds the next breeding loop.

3. Breeding Phase II: Uranium-Plutonium-239 Cycle (LUV Tier)
Reactor: An LUV-tier Advanced Pressurized Fission Reactor (or a higher-tier custom reactor).
Goal: Convert abundant Depleted Uranium (U-238) into powerful Plutonium-239 (Pu-239).
Fertile (Blanket) Fuel: Depleted Uranium (U-238) rods, directly supplied by the spent driver fuel from your IV Thorium breeder. This efficiently recycles a "waste" product.
Driver Fuel: The U-233 you've already bred, or Plutonium-239 itself.
Reprocessing Output (from Irradiated Depleted Uranium Rods):
Plutonium-239 (Pu-239): The primary desired fissile product.
Recyclable Depleted Uranium (U-238): Unconverted U-238, cycled back into new rods.

4. Essential Supporting Processes
Uranium Enrichment: Occurs before uranium is used as a high-efficiency driver fuel. Unenriched uranium oxide is converted to UF6 gas, then enriched (increasing U-235 content) via an Enrichment Plant, and finally converted back to enriched uranium oxide for fuel fabrication.
Reprocessing (General): Never 100% perfect. Utilizes Centrifuges and Chemical Reactors (e.g., with Nitric Acid) to separate valuable products from spent fuels and waste.
Byproducts from Spent Fissile Fuel Reprocessing (e.g., spent U-235, U-233, Pu-239 driver fuels):
Recoverable Fuel: Unfissioned U-235, U-233, Pu-239 for recycling.
Heavier Plutonium Isotopes: (Pu-240, Pu-241, Pu-242) from spent Plutonium fuel.
Minor Actinides (Transplutonic Elements): In high-flux reactors, further neutron capture creates Neptunium (Np), Americium (Am), and Curium (Cm). These are critical for your custom high-tier fuels.
Fission Products: The "ash" of fission, a diverse mix of radioactive elements (e.g., Strontium-90, Iodine-131, Cesium-137, Technetium, Krypton, Xenon). These are generally high-level radioactive waste requiring complex management.
