A Flawed PhoenixWare circuit line would be an excellent way to introduce an early alternative to full PhoenixWare, acting as a stepping stone between UEV-tier circuits and the perfected PhoenixWare models. These circuits would use rarer Earth-based or near-Earth materials but would still be somewhat inferior to their perfected versions, making them a lower-efficiency option for early post-UEV machines.

Flawed PhoenixWare (FPW) Circuit Line

Concept:


How This Balances Automation
Flawed PhoenixWare is cheaper and uses Earth-accessible materials but operates inefficiently (higher power use, lower performance).
Perfect PhoenixWare is far superior but requires exotic post-UEV materials, pushing automation toward dimensional mining, fusion synthesis, and quantum material extraction.
Players can automate Flawed PhoenixWare production as an early step, then later transition to full PhoenixWare circuits once they secure exotic materials.
Would you like me to refine any recipes or add specific circuit mechanics (like efficiency penalties for flawed circuits)?







Flawed PhoenixWare Material Descriptions
Since Flawed PhoenixWare is a stepping stone between UEV and true PhoenixWare, its materials should have an experimental, imperfect feel‚Äîpushing the limits of known technology but not quite achieving the perfection of Phoenix-Enriched materials. These materials are rare but still Earth-accessible, making them viable for early post-UEV automation.


Flawed PhoenixWare Material Balancing
Less efficient than Phoenix-Enriched materials (higher power use, lower performance).
Easier to obtain early in post-UEV progression (still rare, but mineable or craftable).
Encourages automation and material refining before transitioning to full PhoenixWare.


Flawed PhoenixWare Circuits (FPW MAX-Tier)
"The most unstable, barely functional versions of PhoenixWare circuits‚Äîhacked together from high-end components that should work in theory but often collapse under real-world conditions. These circuits burn through power, require constant recalibration, and suffer from unpredictable failures, but they serve as a desperate stepping stone toward true MAX-tier computing."

‚¶ø Flawest PhoenixWare Processor
"A haphazard fusion of quantum circuits and makeshift superconductors. While technically capable of running PhoenixWare-caliber computations, it frequently crashes due to unpredictable quantum fluctuations."

üõ† Downside: Unstable computations, occasional catastrophic failures.

‚¶ø Flawest PhoenixWare Assembly
"Multiple flawed processors arranged into a single, chaotic processing unit. Requires absurd amounts of power to maintain stability, with a high risk of calculation errors and component degradation."

üõ† Downside: Extreme power draw, requires constant cooling.

‚¶ø Flawest PhoenixWare Supercomputer
"A desperate attempt to achieve MAX-tier computation using broken, inefficient methods. While technically capable of post-UEV automation, it constantly requires rebooting and recalibration to prevent full system collapse."

üõ† Downside: Needs frequent manual maintenance, occasional logic failures.

‚¶ø Flawest PhoenixWare Mainframe
"An unstable, overclocked mess of flawed quantum logic cores and superheated processors. It operates at the bleeding edge of self-destruction, only barely holding together long enough to complete calculations before burning itself out."

üõ† Downside: Constant power surges, potential irreversible system crashes.

How Flawed PhoenixWare Works in Progression
Flawed PW is an early attempt at MAX-tier computation, useful but highly inefficient.
Flawest PW is even worse‚Äîa hacked-together, unstable version that barely functions and requires constant upkeep.
Perfected PW is the final goal‚Äîflawless, self-sustaining, and required for the most advanced machines.



thats just called a chanced output üíî
Phoenixvine ‚Äî Today at 1:52 AM
ah yes, that makes sense
and im sure i could find data on that easily
nicksoup ‚Äî Today at 1:52 AM
-10% output chance penalty
Phoenixvine ‚Äî Today at 1:52 AM
make the flawed PW multis have that penalty
upgrade the controller and the casing to phoenix enriched naquad to pw tritanium and neutronium
when good pw multis come
log ‚Äî Today at 1:53 AM
true
Phoenixvine ‚Äî Today at 1:54 AM
pw tritanium would be a uhv mat, and pw neutronium be a uev mat
or smth like that

Parallels based on the recepies base startup energy
Like how EBF overclocks
Phoenixvine ‚Äî Today at 1:57 AM
mk1 compact be flawed phoenixware super computer, which is a circuit unlocked at uhv
kinda feel like flawed pw should be for multis instead of actual circuits
and normal PW be uev, perfected PW be uiv 


Flawed PhoenixWare (FPW) Circuit Line
"An experimental yet imperfect attempt at surpassing UEV-tier computation, Flawed PhoenixWare circuits push known technology beyond its limits. While functional, they suffer from inefficiencies, instability, and higher power consumption. They serve as a stepping stone toward perfected PhoenixWare, allowing for early access to post-UEV automation."

Flawed PhoenixWare circuits work but are suboptimal, offering a middle ground between UEV circuits and the perfected PhoenixWare line. They require less exotic materials than true PhoenixWare but at the cost of higher energy use, lower processing speeds, and increased maintenance requirements.
