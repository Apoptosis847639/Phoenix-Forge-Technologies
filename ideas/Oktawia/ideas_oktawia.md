### energy accessor 
a cable part that would allow the player to extract AE as FE/EU from an ME system, the max extract defined by the amount of accel cards inside and and for EU, the player will have to input a power thingy of a given tier to extract EU in that selected voltage, extract limited by the thingys amps. However the player should not be able to insert EU into ME system in any way to avoid using it as a convinient power station/transformer
### mob storage 
import export bus for mobs, the player would have to craft a special mob storage cell (sth like the mekanisms gases) to store the mobs inside ME system, and would need to have a special item inside the system to extract them to theirs inventory (some kind of entity holder, something like when you need a bucket to extract water), it would also add a few other features
- spawner controller, the player would be able to place a spawner inside this block, and it would generate given entities depositing them straight into ME system, possible accel cards 
- mob grinder, multiblock 5x5x5, consisting of for example a looting block (each would increase the amount of mob drops) or an XP block (each would increase the amount of xp) etc, that would take the selected mob(s) from the system and generate experience shards (items used for example in the auto enchanter) and mob drops, possible accel cards
- damage plane, something like annihilation plane, but instead of breaking block, it would damage entities, possible enchantments and accel cards
### generator
multiblock 7x7x7 consisting of for example crafting storage units, a burn chamber (s), stabilizers, insulation, based on the blocks used and speed upgrades installed it would generate AE starting from 128AE/t up to 16M AE/t, it would take the selected resource (quartz/flux crystals/fluix crystals) from ME system, and burn them for some time determined by the amount of efficiency blocks and burn chambers inside and the accel cards installed, minimal speed should be equivalent to the basic furnace, max speed is a stack of items per burn chamber per tick

### xp shards from the mob grinder
- make new alloys by melting them down with xp shards
- tiab crafting recipe includes xp shards
- stack the chunks of xp in gtceu machine to make bigger chunks
- add it to neutronium to make a black hole
### tinkers ideas
new tiers of the smelters heat, maybe even a new types of smelter, max tier that would make it possible to melt the max tier materials would need to be powered by a star, thats also an infinite power source so it would make one of the creative endgame items. Add quite a lot of alloys, with different stats. 
### black/white hole
add hawking radiation annihilators to the black hole, add enough, and the amount of hawking radiaton starts to get negative which makes the black hole into a white hole. White hole gives some kind of resource generation. Maybe the holes will generate their own specific resources, additional to/instead of normal resource gen. that you would need to use to make max tier, you for example sometimes be abble to get a random quark, and for exmaple adding some kind of quark somwhere (to a recipe/machine or sth) would transfor the output/machine itself into sth else. Maybe enough quark shit will make it possible to achieve higher densities than 100%?
